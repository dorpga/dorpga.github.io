Dorper has recently moved to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for multiple reasons.

## Free
GitHub Pages is free, hosting my own server isn't.

## Jekyll
GitHub Pages provides enhanced [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) hosting.
Jekyll is a "static" website system written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org).
I have rewritten the website so it works with Jekyll.

## Updating
It was difficult to update the website remotely and I had to be careful not to do something that would break the server when I was connecting remotely.
With GitHub Pages, I can instead push to the [site's repository](https://github.com/dorpga/site) and the website regenerated automatically.
